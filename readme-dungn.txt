Project 4 README

* Part A

I implement a program called "ps" to print out all processes with its pid, name, high and low priority run time. To run the program, just enter "ps" in xv6 console.

I also write 2 test programs: testpri and testpri2:
- testpri will test if low priority process will never run while there exist 1 high priority process.
- testpri2 will test that priority processes will run in a round-robin scheduler while low priority ones have to wait

* Part B-1

Run the test program "fscheck"

* Part B-2
